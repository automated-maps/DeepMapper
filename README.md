![logo](./images/DeepMapper_logo_v3.png)

DeepMapper is a cutting-edge automated mapping solution designed specifically for OpenStreetMap. Leveraging the power of deep learning, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), this project offers a robust framework for extracting and classifying objects from remote sensing imagery, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automated mapping processes.

## Key Features:
- Spatial Data Crawling
- OSM-GAN for change detection
- Poly-GAN for regularization
- Change Verification
- OSM-acceptable changeset creation

## How to Use:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepMapper.git`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-Follow the detailed instructions in the documentation for setting up and running DeepMapper.
